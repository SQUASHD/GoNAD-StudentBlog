# Student Blog Frontend

Welcome to the part of the stack that puts the 'N' in 'GoNAD' â€“ the NextJS frontend of my probably (...okay, definitely) over-engineered Student Blog project.

## My Approach
Why double the effort? In a typical scenario, I'd have gone full-stack, enjoying the seamless harmony of an all-in-one solution. Having built the backend first, I wanted to experience the unique hurdles of tying a frontend to a pre-existing, fully-formed backend. I've intentionally tried to limit the use of server actions. With the new experimental taint API it's recommended to use DTOs and a data access layer (go figure, huh!) to safely handle sensitive data. But why would I repeat the work that I've already done with the backend?

## Features
- Shadcn's UI library
- Some simple JWT handling
- Protected routes / conditional rendering
- No server actions, no fuss
- React server components

## Setting It Up
TODO
